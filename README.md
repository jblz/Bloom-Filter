# Bloom Filter

My attempt at implmenting a bloom filter.

*"A Bloom filter is a data structure designed to tell you, rapidly and memory-efficiently, whether an element is present in a set."*

**Demo:**  https://sacert.github.io/Bloom-Filter/

Bloom Filters are a *probabilistic* data structure as they can only tell if an element is *probably* within the set or not in the set at all.

Illistrated within the demo above - add in items within the list and search for them.
